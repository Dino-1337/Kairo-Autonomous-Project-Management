# 🚀 Autonomous Project Manager

**AI-powered autonomous project coordination that transforms ideas into actionable plans with automatic team assignments and Slack notifications.**

This system acts as an intelligent layer between project requests and your team, automatically breaking down complex goals into specific, skill-based tasks and assigning them to the right people.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **🤖 AI Task Decomposition**: Automatically analyzes natural language requests and breaks them down into 4-6 actionable, logical tasks.
- **🧠 Smart Skill Matching**: Assigns tasks to team members based on their specific skill sets (e.g., assigning "API Design" to a Backend Engineer).
- **⚡ Autonomous Coordination**: Handles the "Project Manager" role by estimating hours, setting dependencies, and determining urgency.
- **💬 Slack Integration**: Instantly notifies the team via Slack when tasks are assigned.
- **✨ Modern UI**: A beautiful, responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS for managing the workspace.

## 🌟 New Features

- **🔗 LangChain/LangGraph Orchestration**: Replaced manual HTTP clients with LangChain OpenRouter client and introduced a LangGraph StateGraph (`workflow_app`) for robust routing, task decomposition, and assignment.
- **💾 Project Data Model & Persistence**: Added `SQLModel`-based database layer with fallback to SQLite for Projects, Ideas, Tasks, Meeting Notes, and Project Events, along with REST endpoints.
- **📊 Project Dashboard UI**: Introduced a new `/projects` route and `ProjectsDashboard` page matching the glass/neumorphic style to create projects, add ideas, manage tasks, and view project timelines.
- **🛠️ Developer Ergonomics**: Added `start.ps1` and `start.sh` scripts to easily spin up the frontend and backend together, and updated dependencies to include LangChain/LangGraph and database requirements.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React (Vite)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State/Routing**: React Router, TanStack Query

### Backend

- **AI/LLM**: OpenRouter (DeepSeek/Mistral models)
- **Integration**: Slack SDK
- **Server**: Uvicorn

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- An OpenRouter API Key
- A Slack Bot Token (optional, for notifications)

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure Environment
# Create a .env file in /backend with:
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
# SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your_token_here

# Run Server
python app.py
```
The backend will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Development Server
npm run dev
```
The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🎛️ How It Works

1.  **Input**: Enter a project idea (e.g., "Launch a new marketing campaign for Q4").
2.  **Decomposition**: The AI analyzes the request and breaks it down into sub-tasks (Design, Copywriting, Analytics setup).
3.  **Assignment**: It checks the `team_config.json` to find the best match for each task based on skills.
4.  **Output**: A structured plan is generated, displayed on the UI, and sent to Slack.
